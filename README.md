## 🌱 My Journey
<details open>
<summary><b>Why I chose Software Engineering</b></summary>

I started software engineering because I’ve always been fascinated by how technology powers everyday life — from banking apps to cloud services.  
My curiosity grew into a drive to **understand how systems work beneath the surface**, especially how they stay reliable at scale.  

I’m passionate about **API design, data modeling, and distributed systems**, and I draw inspiration from **engineers who build solutions that make life easier for millions of people**.

## 🎯 My Vision
I aim to **engineer back-end systems that scale seamlessly and empower people and businesses**.  

That’s why I’d love to work on **fintech platforms, large-scale APIs, cloud-native applications, and infrastructure that supports real-time services** — projects where performance, reliability, and impact matter.
